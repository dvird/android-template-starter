# Android Architecture Template Starter

In this project you'll find:
*   User Interface built with **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)** 
*   A single-activity architecture, using **[Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)**.
*   A presentation layer that contains a Compose screen (View) and a **ViewModel** per screen (or feature).
*   Reactive UIs using **[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)** and **[coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)** for asynchronous operations.
*   A **data layer** with a repository and two data sources (local using Room and a fake remote).
*   Two **product flavors**, `mock` and `prod`, [to ease development and testing](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/12/leveraging-product-flavors-in-android.html).
*   A collection of unit, integration and e2e **tests**, including "shared" tests that can be run on emulator/device.
*   Dependency injection using [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).

## Why a to-do app?

The app in this project aims to be simple enough that you can understand it quickly, but complex enough to showcase difficult design decisions and testing scenarios. For more information, see the [app's specification](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/wiki/To-do-app-specification).

## Who is it for?

*   Intermediate developers and beginners looking for a way to structure their app in a testable and maintainable way.
*   Advanced developers looking for quick reference.
